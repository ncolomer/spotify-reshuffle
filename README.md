## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create a Spotify App

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Click **"Create an app"**
3. Fill in the details and create
4. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` as a **Redirect URI**
5. Save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Set Up Authentication

You can provide your Spotify credentials in two ways:

#### Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended)
```bash
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id_here"
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret_here"
```

💡 **Tip**: Add these to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for permanent setup.

#### Option B: Command Line Arguments
```bash
spotify-reshuffle \
  --spotify-client-id "your_client_id_here" \
  --spotify-client-secret "your_client_secret_here" \
  [other options...]
```

### 3. Run the Tool

```bash
# Basic usage - combine playlists into a new playlist (using environment variables)
spotify-reshuffle --target-playlist-name "My Shuffled Mix" --source-playlists "playlist_id_1,playlist_id_2"

# Include your liked songs too
spotify-reshuffle --target-playlist-name "Ultimate Mix" --source-playlists "playlist_id_1" --include-liked

# Use command line arguments for credentials
spotify-reshuffle \
  --spotify-client-id "your_client_id" \
  --spotify-client-secret "your_client_secret" \
  --target-playlist-name "My Mix" \
  --include-liked

# Use a custom cache location
spotify-reshuffle --target-playlist-name "My Mix" --include-liked --cache-path "~/.spotify-cache.json"
```

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Find Playlist IDs

You can find playlist IDs in the Spotify URL:
```
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
                                 ↑ This is the playlist ID
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Get help
spotify-reshuffle --help

# Combine two playlists
spotify-reshuffle \
  --target-playlist-name "My Party Mix" \
  --source-playlists "37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M,1G4dQaJc8VhG4D5aYi7iWv"

# Include your liked songs only
spotify-reshuffle \
  --target-playlist-name "My Liked Shuffled" \
  --include-liked

# Combine everything - playlists + liked songs
spotify-reshuffle \
  --target-playlist-name "Ultimate Mix" \
  --source-playlists "37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M,1G4dQaJc8VhG4D5aYi7iWv" \
  --include-liked
```

### Advanced Examples

```bash
# Use custom cache location
spotify-reshuffle \
  --target-playlist-name "My Mix" \
  --include-liked \
  --cache-path "/tmp/spotify-tokens.json"

# Update an existing playlist (will clear and re-populate)
spotify-reshuffle \
  --target-playlist-name "Weekly Mix" \
  --source-playlists "37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M"

### Command Line Options

```
spotify-reshuffle [OPTIONS] --target-playlist-name <TARGET_PLAYLIST_NAME> --spotify-client-id <SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID> --spotify-client-secret <SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET>

Options:
  -s, --source-playlists <SOURCE_PLAYLISTS>
          Comma-separated playlist IDs to use as sources
  
  -t, --target-playlist-name <TARGET_PLAYLIST_NAME>
          Name of the target playlist to create/update
  
      --include-liked
          Include liked songs in the shuffle
  
      --cache-path <CACHE_PATH>
          Path to the cache file for storing authentication tokens
  
      --spotify-client-id <SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID>
          Your Spotify app's client ID. Get it from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications [env: SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID]

      --spotify-client-secret <SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET>
          Your Spotify app's client secret. Get it from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications [env: SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET]

  -h, --help
          Print help
  
  -V, --version
          Print version
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Your Spotify App Client ID | ✅ Yes |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your Spotify App Client Secret | ✅ Yes |

💡 **Note**: You can also provide these values as command line arguments (`--spotify-client-id` and `--spotify-client-secret`). Command line arguments take precedence over environment variables.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **🔐 Authentication**: Initiates Spotify OAuth flow (opens browser)
2. **📥 Collection**: Retrieves tracks from specified playlists and/or liked songs
3. **✨ Validation**: Filters out invalid, local, or unavailable tracks
4. **🧹 Deduplication**: Removes duplicate tracks across all sources
5. **🎲 Shuffling**: Randomly shuffles the final track list
6. **📝 Playlist**: Creates new playlist or clears existing one
7. **⬆️ Upload**: Adds all tracks in batches of 100 (Spotify API limit)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Missing Spotify Credentials
```
error: the following required arguments were not provided:
  --spotify-client-id <SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID>
  --spotify-client-secret <SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET>
```
**Solutions**:
1. **Set environment variables** (recommended):
   ```bash
   export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id_here"
   export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret_here"
   ```

2. **Use command line arguments**:
   ```bash
   spotify-reshuffle --spotify-client-id "your_client_id" --spotify-client-secret "your_client_secret" [other options...]
   ```

### Authentication Failed
```
Error: OAuth error: invalid_client
```
**Solutions**:
1. Double-check your Client ID and Secret
2. Verify redirect URI is exactly: `http://localhost:8888/callback`
3. Ensure your Spotify app settings match

### Playlist Not Found
```
Error: Playlist not found or access denied
```
**Solutions**:
1. Verify the playlist ID is correct
2. Make sure the playlist is public or owned by you
3. Check that you have the right permissions

### Network/API Issues
```
Error: Request failed with status 429
```
**Solution**: Spotify API rate limiting. Wait a few minutes and try again.

### Permission Denied
```
Error: Permission denied while creating cache file
```
**Solution**: Use `--cache-path` to specify a writable location:
```bash
spotify-reshuffle --cache-path "~/spotify-cache.json" [other options]
```
